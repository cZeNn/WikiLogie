            <h2>Chp5 - Primordial Creatures and Famous Monsters</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Greek mythology is populated by fantastic creatures born from the primordial deities. Among them are the Giants, the Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires, children of Ouranos and Gaia. The Cyclopes,
                    master blacksmiths, offer Zeus his lightning, Poseidon his trident and Hades his helmet of invisibility. The Hecatonchires, for their part, have a hundred arms and colossal strength.
                    <br>
                    One of the most fearsome monsters is Typhon, engendered by Gaia and Tartarus to challenge the gods. With his hundreds of fire-breathing heads, he is Zeus' most powerful adversary. After a fierce fight,
                    Zeus manages to defeat him and imprisons him under Mount Etna. <br>
                    Another primordial being is Echidna, the "mother of monsters", who gives birth to several famous creatures such as Cerberus, the Lernaean Hydra and the Sphinx. She lives hidden in a cave,
                    generating plagues to challenge heroes and sow chaos in the mortal world.
                    <br>
                    These creatures embody primitive forces that gods and heroes must fight to establish a stable order. Their role is fundamental in myths,
                    symbolizing both the original disorder and the need to confront it in order to progress.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp5 - The Monsters of Legends and their Clashes with the Heroes</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Among the famous monsters, the Minotaur is one of the most striking figures. Born from the union between Pasipha√´ and a divine bull sent by Poseidon, he is locked in a labyrinth designed by Daedalus.
                    Theseus, helped by Ariadne, manages to kill him and puts an end to the sacrifices imposed by Minos.
                    <br>
                    The Lernaean Hydra is another fearsome creature. This multi-headed serpent grows back each time one is cut off, making combat almost impossible.
                    Heracles manages to defeat it by cauterizing the wounds with the help of his nephew Iolaos, thus preventing the regeneration of the heads.
                    <br>
                    The Sphinx is a half-woman, half-lion creature that terrorizes Thebes by posing a riddle to travelers. Those who fail are devoured. Oedipus manages to solve
                    the riddle ("What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?"), which prompts the Sphinx to commit suicide.
                    <br>
                    Finally, Cerberus, the three-headed dog guardian of the Underworld, prevents souls from leaving the realm of the dead. Only Hercules manages to master him in one 
                    of his twelve labors, managing to capture him before bringing him back to Hades.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp5 - Magical and Ambivalent Creatures</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Some mythological creatures are not entirely evil, but play an ambivalent role. The Sirens, for example, are fascinating beings who attract sailors with their enchanting song to lead them to their doom. Ulysses, 
                    warned of the danger, has himself tied to the mast of his ship to listen to them without succumbing to their charm.
                    <br>
                    The Centaurs are half-man, half-horse. Some, like Chiron, are wise and instruct heroes like Achilles and Jason. Others, like Nessus, are brutal and savage. Nessus tries to rape Deianira,
                    which indirectly leads to the death of Heracles.
                    <br>
                    The Gorgons are three monstrous sisters, the most famous of which is Medusa. Her gaze petrifies anyone who crosses it. Perseus manages to kill her using a reflective shield given to her by Athena. 
                    He then uses his head as a weapon before offering it to the goddess.
                    <br>
                    Finally, Pegasus, the winged horse, is a magical creature that helps Bellerophon defeat the Chimera. After the fall of his rider, Pegasus joins Olympus, becoming the horse of Zeus and a symbol
                    of freedom and inspiration.
