            <h2>Chp2 - Zeus and the Supreme Gods</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Zeus is the supreme god of Greek mythology, ruling over the heavens and lightning from Mount Olympus. After defeating the Titans, he established a divine order in which each god had a specific function.
                    He is often depicted with a scepter and a lightning bolt, symbols of his absolute authority. As king of the gods, he watches over the harmony of the world and punishes mortals and immortals who transgress divine laws.
                    <br>
                    Married to Hera, he is however known for his many infidelities with goddesses, nymphs and mortals. His adventures give birth to heroes such as Heracles, Perseus and Minos. These unions reflect
                    Zeus' power but also his capricious and passionate character.
                    <br>
                    In addition to his role as sovereign, Zeus is the god of justice and oaths. He intervenes in divine and human conflicts to ensure the balance of the cosmos. In some legends, he punishes unjust kings
                    and protects the weak, although he often favors those he likes.
                    <br>
                    His power is immense, but it is not absolute. He respects Fate (the Moirai), which even exceeds his authority. This submission to a higher force shows that, despite his supremacy,
                    Zeus remains a god subject to a larger cosmic order.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp2 - Poseidon, Hades and the Division of the World</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    After the war against the Titans, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades drew lots for control of the world. Zeus obtained the sky, Poseidon the seas, and Hades the underworld. Each rules his domain with immense power, but their relations remain strained, especially between Poseidon and Zeus.
                    <br>
                    Poseidon is the god of the oceans, storms and earthquakes. Impulsive and angry, he is feared by sailors, who offer him sacrifices to appease his fury. His trident, a fearsome weapon, can stir up the seas and cause devastating tidal waves. He is also the creator of horses and is often depicted on a chariot pulled by sea creatures.
                    <br>
                    Hades, on the other hand, rules over the dead. Unlike the other gods, he does not reside on Olympus but in the Underworld, where he is feared but respected. He is not an evil god, but rather a ruthless and just ruler.
                    His kingdom is guarded by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and he ensures that souls do not leave the underworld.
                    <br>
                    Although Zeus is the most powerful, Poseidon and Hades have a major influence on mythological events. Poseidon intervenes in the Trojan War and curses Odysseus, while Hades plays a key role in
                    the myth of Persephone, thus explaining the cycle of the seasons.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp2 - The Other Olympian Gods</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Olympus is populated by many gods, each with a particular function. Hera, Zeus' wife, is the goddess of marriage and fidelity, but she is also jealous and vengeful towards her husband's lovers. Her influence is
                    visible in several myths where she persecutes Zeus' illegitimate children, notably Heracles.
                    <br>
                    Athena, born from the head of Zeus, is the goddess of wisdom, strategy and just war. Protector of Athens, she embodies intelligence and prudence. Unlike Ares, the god of brutal war, she favors tactics and
                    thought in battles. She is also a figure of civilization and the arts, teaching humans crafts and justice.
                    <br>
                    Apollo and Artemis, twins of Zeus and Leto, dominate several domains. Apollo is the god of light, music and prophecy. He is venerated in Delphi, where he delivers oracles through the Pythia. Artemis, for her part, is the goddess of the hunt and the wild, 
                    protector of young girls and fearsome towards those who dare to defy her.
                    <br>
                    Finally, Hermes, Hephaestus and Dionysus occupy various roles. Hermes is the messenger of the gods and the guide of souls to the Underworld, while Hephaestus, god of fire and the forge, is a skilled craftsman but rejected because of his deformity. 
                    Dionysus, god of wine and ecstasy, represents both joy and madness, celebrated through mystical festivals where the boundary between the human and the divine is erased.
