            <h2>Chp3 - The Gigantomachy, the War against the Giants</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    After defeating the Titans, the Olympian gods thought they had established their supremacy. However, Gaea, furious at the fate of the Titans, gave birth to the Giants to
                    challenge Zeus and the other gods. These colossal creatures were fearsome, endowed with superhuman strength and capable of threatening the divine order.
                    <br>
                    The Gigantomachy broke out when the Giants, led by Porphyrion and Alcyoneus, attacked Olympus. Zeus and the other gods fought fiercely, but there was a prophecy:
                    only the gods with the help of a mortal could defeat the Giants. Thus, Heracles, the greatest of heroes, was called to participate in the fight.
                    <br>
                    Thanks to his prodigious strength, Heracles defeated several Giants, helping Zeus, Athena and Apollo to triumph. Alcyoneus, immortal in his native land, was dragged out of his territory and killed,
                    while Porphyrion, enraged, tried to attack Hera but was struck down by Zeus before being finished off by Heracles.
                    <br>
                    After a fierce battle, the gods managed to crush the rebellion of the Giants. This victory confirmed their domination over the universe and reinforced their legitimacy as absolute sovereigns
                    of the cosmos. Gaia, defeated but still resentful, then put another plan in place: she gave birth to Typhon, the most fearsome monster in Greek mythology.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp3 - Typhon, the Ultimate Monster</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Typhon, born of Gaia and Tartarus, was a gigantic creature, more fearsome than the Titans and Giants combined. He had hundreds of serpent heads, immense wings and
                    eyes that breathed fire. His terrifying voice sowed panic among gods and mortals.
                    <br>
                    When he attacked Olympus, the gods, terrified, fled to Egypt and took the form of animals to hide. Only Zeus dared to confront him, but Typhon was so powerful that he managed to tear his tendons
                    and imprison him in a cavern. With the help of Hermes and Apollo, Zeus recovered his strength and returned to the fight.
                    <br>
                    A titanic battle ensued, shaking the Earth itself. Zeus hurled lightning and storms at Typhon, while the monster retaliated with destructive winds and flames. Eventually, Zeus managed to
                    bury him under Mount Etna in Sicily, where his roars and anger would give birth to volcanic eruptions.
                    <br>
                    With Typhon's defeat, divine order was definitively established. No being could challenge the supremacy of Zeus and the Olympian gods. This victory marked the end of the great cosmic threats
                    and allowed the gods to concentrate on their interactions with mortals.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp3 - The Trojan War, the Conflict of Men and Gods</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    While previous wars were fought between the gods themselves, the Trojan War was the greatest conflict involving both gods and humans. It began with the famous Judgement of Paris: during a divine banquet,
                    the goddess of discord, Eris, threw a golden apple with the inscription "To the fairest." Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite fought over it, asking Paris, the Trojan prince, to choose the fairest.
                    <br>
                    Each goddess offered him a gift in exchange for his choice. Hera promised him kingship, Athena wisdom and victory in battle, but Paris chose Aphrodite, who promised him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife
                    of the Greek king Menelaus. This act angered the Greeks, who swore to get Helen back, thus starting the war against Troy.
                    <br>
                    For ten years, the greatest heroes fought each other: Achilles, the mightiest of the Greeks, killed Hector, the most valiant of the Trojans, while Odysseus used cunning and strategy. The gods themselves took sides in the conflict: Zeus
                    tried to be neutral, but Poseidon favored the Greeks while Apollo and Aphrodite supported the Trojans.
                    <br>
                    Finally, the war ended with the ruse of the Trojan horse. Odysseus devised a plan to hide Greek warriors in a huge wooden horse, offered as a gift to the Trojans. The latter, believing it to be a sacred offering, brought the horse
                    within their walls, allowing the Greeks to invade and destroy the city. Troy was reduced to ashes, and the war ended, leaving an indelible mark on mythological history.
