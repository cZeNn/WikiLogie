            <h2>Chp4 - Hercules and his Twelve Labors</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Heracles (or Hercules to the Romans) is probably the most famous of the Greek heroes. Son of Zeus and Alcmene, a mortal, he is endowed with superhuman strength.
                    However, Hera, jealous of his existence, cursed him from birth. She sent two snakes into his cradle, but the young Heracles strangled them effortlessly.
                    <br>
                    As an adult, he was the victim of a fit of madness provoked by Hera and killed his wife Megara and their children. To atone for this crime, the oracle of Delphi required him to
                    serve King Eurystheus, who entrusted him with twelve labors, each representing a superhuman feat.
                    <br>
                    Among his trials, he faced mythical creatures: he killed the Nemean lion, whose invincible skin became his armor; he defeated the Lernaean Hydra, a monster whose heads grew back;
                    and he captures the Erymanthian boar and the Ceryneian hind. Other labors take him to the ends of the world, such as the theft of the golden apples of the Hesperides or the capture of the dog of the Underworld, Cerberus.
                    <br>
                    After completing his labors, Heracles continues to be a wandering hero, facing many dangers. He ends up being poisoned by his own wife, Deianira, and dies in excruciating pain.
                    However, Zeus rewards him by offering him immortality and a place among the gods of Olympus.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp4 - Theseus and the Quest of the Minotaur</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Theseus is the founding hero of Athens. Son of King Aegeus (or the god Poseidon according to some versions), he is raised far from the city and must prove his worth before joining his father. On his way,
                    he accomplishes several feats by eliminating bandits and monsters that terrorize Greece.
                    <br>
                    His greatest feat is his victory against the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster locked in the labyrinth of Crete. Each year, Athens must offer fourteen young people as sacrifices to the Minotaur,
                    a tribute imposed by King Minos. Theseus decides to put an end to this injustice and volunteers to confront the creature.
                    <br>
                    Thanks to the help of Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, who gives him a ball of magic thread to find his way, he enters the labyrinth, fights the Minotaur and kills him. He then manages to
                    escape by bringing the captives back to Athens, putting an end to the bloody tribute.
                    <br>
                    However, his return is marked by tragedy: he forgets to hoist the white sail announcing his victory. His father Aegeus, believing his son dead, throws himself into the sea that will bear his name, the Aegean Sea.
                    Theseus then becomes king of Athens, establishing the foundations of democracy and governing wisely.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp4 - Jason and the Golden Fleece</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Jason is a hero known for his quest for the Golden Fleece. The rightful heir to the throne of Iolcos, he is dispossessed by his uncle Pelias, who promises to give him back his throne if he brings back the Golden Fleece,
                    a magical artifact guarded in Colchis, on the other side of the known world.
                    <br>
                    Jason assembles a crew of heroes, the Argonauts, including Heracles, Orpheus and Castor and Pollux. Aboard the ship Argo, they go through many trials: they face the Harpies,
                    pass the dangerous rocks of the Symplegades and resist the bewitching sirens.
                    <br>
                    Arriving in Colchis, Jason must face King Aeetes, who refuses to give him the Fleece. With the help of Medea, a sorceress who fell in love with him, he completes several tests: he tames fire-breathing bulls, sows dragon teeth
                    that transform into warriors, then manages to steal the Golden Fleece by putting its guardian, a gigantic dragon, to sleep.
                    <br>
                    Jason and Medea's escape is marked by betrayal and murder. Medea betrays her family to follow Jason, but he later abandons her. Furious, she takes revenge by killing their own children. Jason,
                    cursed and fallen, dies miserably, crushed under the wreckage of his own ship, the Argo.
