            <h2>Chp6 - Mythology in Culture and Literature</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Greek mythology had a profound influence on ancient literature. Homer‚Äôs great epics, The Iliad and The Odyssey, are founding stories that recount the Trojan War and the voyage of Odysseus. Hesiod,
                    with The Theogony, offers a detailed account of the birth of the gods and the world. These works laid the foundations of Western literature.
                    <br>
                    In Antiquity, the Greek tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides explored the tragic destinies of heroes, such as Oedipus, Antigone or Medea. These plays, performed in Greek theatres, aimed to
                    educate and move the public while transmitting moral and philosophical values.
                    <br>
                    Mythology also influenced Latin literature, notably with Virgil and his Aeneid, which tells the story of Aeneas‚Äô flight after the fall of Troy and the legendary founding of Rome. Ovid,
                    with his Metamorphoses, compiles a multitude of mythological stories that have marked European art and culture.
                    <br>
                    Over the centuries, many writers have revisited these myths. Authors such as Jean Racine (Phaedrus), Goethe (Faust, inspired by Prometheus) and even modern writers have drawn on
                    this inexhaustible source to reinterpret the stories and give them new meanings.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp6 - The Influence of Mythology in Art and Architecture</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Since ancient times, Greek mythology has inspired art in all its forms. The sculptures of Greek temples depicted gods and heroes in epic scenes:
                    the Parthenon in Athens, dedicated to Athena, is full of bas-reliefs illustrating her exploits.
                    <br>
                    Ceramic painting is another important form of expression: Greek amphorae and vases illustrate mythological scenes such as the Twelve Labors of Heracles or the adventures of Odysseus.
                    These objects were not only decorative, but also educational, transmitting the myths to future generations.
                    <br>
                    During the Renaissance, Europe rediscovered Greek mythology thanks to the humanists. Painters such as Botticelli (The Birth of Venus), Titian (Dana√´), and
                    Rubens (The Judgement of Paris) drew inspiration from ancient stories to create immortal masterpieces. <br>
                    Even in architecture, Greek mythology has left its mark. Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, directly inspired by Greek temples,
                    are omnipresent in official buildings, from Washington to Paris. Classical aesthetics remain a model of beauty and harmony.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp6 - Greek Mythology in Modern and Popular Culture</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Even today, Greek mythology is everywhere. In cinema, films like Troy, Percy Jackson, Clash of the Titans and Wonder Woman reinterpret the myths by adapting them to a modern audience.
                    Superheroes themselves, like Superman or Thor (inspired by Norse mythology), share many traits with ancient heroes.
                    <br>
                    In literature and comics, novels like Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson saga modernize mythology by making it accessible to younger generations. Manga and anime,
                    like Saint Seiya (Knights of the Zodiac), also draw on these timeless stories.
                    <br>
                    Greek mythology has also left its mark on language and vocabulary. Expressions like "an Achilles heel" (a fatal weakness), "open Pandora's box" (trigger a series of misfortunes)
                    or "a torture of Tantalus" (an inaccessible desire) are still used in everyday language. <br>
                    Finally, even science and astronomy pay homage to Greek myths: planets and constellations bear the names of gods and heroes (Jupiter, Venus, Orion), and many
                    companies and brands draw inspiration from mythology for their names and logos (Nike, Herm√®s, Amazon).
