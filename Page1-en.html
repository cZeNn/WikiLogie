            <h2>Chp1 - The Creation of the World</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    Greek mythology begins with a primordial entity called Chaos, representing a void without form or limit. From this nothingness were born the first fundamental elements:
                    Gaia (the Earth), Ouranos (the Sky), Nyx (the Night) and Erebus (the Darkness). Gaia gave birth to mountains, rivers and seas, thus creating a structured world from the original chaos.
                    <br>
                    Ouranos, by uniting with Gaia, engendered the Titans, the Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires, powerful creatures but feared by their own father. The Cyclopes, known for their single eye in the middle of their forehead, were excellent blacksmiths, while the Hecatonchires, with a hundred arms and fifty heads, symbolized brute force and chaos.
                    <br>
                    For fear of being dethroned, Ouranos imprisoned his children in Tartarus, a deep underground abyss. This cruelty revolted Gaia, who sought an ally among her sons to overthrow their father. Only Cronus,
                    the most ambitious of the Titans, agreed to carry out this plan. She gave him a sharp sickle that she had fashioned from stone.
                    <br>
                    Cronus ambushed Uranus and, with his sickle, cruelly mutilated him, thus depriving him of his power. From the spilled blood new creatures were born: the Erinyes, spirits of vengeance; the Giants,
                    colossal beings born to defy the gods; and the Nymphs, spirits of nature. Moreover, the seed of Uranus, fallen into the sea, gave birth to Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.
                </p>

            <h2>Chp1 - Age of Titans</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    After overthrowing Ouranos, Cronus became the master of the world and established his reign over the Titans. He married his sister Rhea, with whom he had several children: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. This new
                    order seemed prosperous, but Cronus was haunted by a prophecy announcing that one of his children would dethrone him, just as he had done with his father.
                    <br>
                    To avoid this fate, Cronus adopted a drastic measure: as soon as one of his children was born, he swallowed him immediately. Thus, he swallowed his first five children, locking them alive in his stomach.
                    Rhea, horrified by this act, looked for a way to save her last-born, Zeus.
                    <br>
                    With the help of Gaia, Rhea gave birth to Zeus in secret, on the island of Crete. To trick Cronus, she gave him a swaddled stone, which he swallowed without suspecting the deception. Meanwhile, Zeus grew up in safety,
                    raised by the nymph Amalthea and fed on the milk of a divine goat.
                    <br>
                    When he became an adult, Zeus decided to confront his father. With the help of Metis, a cunning Titaness, he made Cronus drink a potion that forced him to regurgitate his brothers and sisters. Together, the young gods, now called the Olympians,
                    declared war on the Titans, sparking a cataclysmic conflict known as the Titanomachy.
                </p>
                
            <h2>Chp1 - The Advent of the Olympian Gods</h2>
                <p class="Text">
                    The Titanomachy was a titanic war that lasted ten years, pitting the young gods led by Zeus against the Titans led by Cronus. The Olympians found allies by freeing the Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires from Tartarus, who
                    offered them divine weapons: thunder and lightning for Zeus, a trident for Poseidon, and a helmet of invisibility for Hades.
                    <br>
                    Thanks to these new weapons and the support of the Hecatonchires, who threw enormous boulders at the Titans, Zeus and his allies won the victory. Cronus and the Titans were imprisoned in Tartarus, under the guard of the
                    Hecatonchires, while the Olympians took power.
                    <br>
                    Zeus, having become king of the gods, shared the world with his brothers: Poseidon received the seas, Hades the underworld, and he himself kept the sky and supreme power. The other gods found their place on Mount Olympus, where they
                    established a new divine order, closer to mortals than the Titans were.
                    <br>
                    Unlike the Titans, the Olympian gods were subject to human emotions: jealousy, love, vengeance, and pride. This made them both fascinating and unpredictable, and their interaction with humans
                    would give rise to a multitude of myths and legends.
